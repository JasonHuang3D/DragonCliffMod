Make sure you have the original copy of the game. Any modifications applied to the game files would crash!

1）The manager_13.x.x. is the host app, file name start with "Mod_" is mod file(a zip file);

2) Install manager patches to the game by opening UnityModManagerApp.exe，click install. Normally, the app will automatically find the game location, otherwise click the button to locate the folder where contains game.exe.

3）Once you installed the manager patches to the game successfully, install mod files by dragging each of mod file( file name start with 'Mod_') to mod panel of UnityModManagerApp. UnityModManger would install the mod for you, if status shown is not ok, try to right click the mod to install it again.
